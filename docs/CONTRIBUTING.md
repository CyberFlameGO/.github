   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

# Style Guide


## Principles

* **Make it approachable.** Use familiar language and don't assume the reader has prior topic knowledge.
* **Keep it concise.** Use the simplest possible language and link to outside content for deeper dives.
* **Think about the community.** Add content that will benefit many vs. an individual.

## Grammar and usage

### Ampersands
Use "and" rather than an ampersand unless you’re referencing a brand name, for example: Procter & Gamble.

### Commas
Always use the [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma). 

### Dates
Include and spell out the month. Include the day number without the "th" or "nd" at the end, for example: October 12.

### Exclamation points
Avoid exclamation points in topic pages and collections.


### Numbers
Write out “one” and every number less than 10.

### Users
Avoid using "users" in favor of developers, people, or a more specific description of the group of people.

### Words that can be tricky
- **Agile (e.g. agile development):** Don’t capitalize “agile” unless it’s starting a sentence.
- **Email:** Use “email”, not "e-mail."
- **Internet:** Don’t capitalize “internet” unless it’s starting a sentence.
- **Open source:**
  - Adjective: “Open source” is always lowercase, except when at the start of the sentence. You can use it as an adjective without a hyphen, as in “open source project” or “open source software.”
  - Noun: You can also use the term on its own to refer to open source in general, as in “give back to open source."
  - Verb: It’s acceptable to use open source as a verb when referring to a project that has been “open sourced” or that you intend to “open source.”
- **Pull request:** Never abbreviate "pull request." "Pull request" is always lowercase unless it's starting a sentence.
- **Repository:** Never abbreviate "repository." "Repository" is always lowercase unless it's starting a sentence.
